> Not to be confused with [[Probability Mass Function]]

Used for [[Continuous Random Variables]], $X$ can be described with a probability density function $f(x)$.

## Properties
$f(x)$ is a integrable function that satisfies the conditions:
- $f(x) \geq 0, x \in S$ 
- $\int_S f(x)dx = 1$ - sum of all probabilities is 1
- If $(a,b) \subseteq S$, then:
$$P(a < x < b) = \int_a^bf(x)dx$$
