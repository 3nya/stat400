[[Discrete Random Variable]] references variables that are countable. **Continuous** is uncountable -- floating point etc. 

We can use the [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]] for using continuous random variables. 
$$F(X) = \int_a^xf(t)dt$$
Where $F(X)$ represents the [[Cummulative Mass Function]] and $f(x)$ js tbe [[Probability Mass Function]]


## Properties

Continuious functions cannot calculate probabilities the same way discrete functions did. For example, $P(X=x) = 0$ for all $x$.

Instead, we will find the probability that $x$ is within an interval or range.
