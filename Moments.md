## Properties
the $r^{th}$ moment of a [[Discrete Random Variable]], $X$ is $E[X']$
> also known as moment about the origin, or raw moment


the $r^{th}$ central moment of a random variable $X$, is the expected value of the $r^{th}$ power of the deviation of a random variable from it's mean: $E[(X - \mu_X)^r]$
