Refers to distributions such as the [[Geometric Distribution]] and the [[Exponential Distribution]] where past outcomes do not affect future outcomes.

Discrete memorylessness,
$X$ total amount of trials for first success
$$P[X>m+n\mid X \leq m] = P[X>n]$$

Continuous Memorylessness,
$X$ total time for first success
$$P[X>t+x\mid X \leq t] = P[X>s]$$
