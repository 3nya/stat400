If all the elements in a sample space are **discrete** (real, countable numbers)

If $S$ is a subset of the real numbers , $S$ is a discrete sample space.

If $x \in S$, x is a discrete random variable.


Therefore, it has a [[Probability Mass Function]]
[[Expected Value]]
[[Variance]]
[[Standard Deviation]]

## Linear transformations
[[Expected Value]]
$E[aX + b] = a \cdot E[X] + b$

**for distributions, notice that its only multiplied** 
[[Variance]]
$Var[aX+b] = a^2 \cdot Var[X]$

[[Standard Deviation]]
$SD[aX+b] = |a| \cdot SD[X]$
