A [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]] that allows for **smaller sample sizes** or when the **population [[Standard Deviation|standard deviation]]** is unknown.

When the **population** standard deviation $\sigma$ is unknown, opt to using the T distribution, where you can use the **sample** standard deviation $s$ instead.

If $s$ is used, its used in the same way $\sigma$ would've been used. 
For example when finding sample error:
With $\sigma$
$$\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

Without $\sigma$ 
$$\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

In addition to using $s$, the T distribution also needs to know the degrees of freedom $df = n - 1$. 

## Using T Distribution
All the same use cases as [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]]!
ie 
- Making [[Confidence Intervals|confidence intervals]]
