For a random variable $X$ , the probability that the random variable takes a value $x$ is $P(X = x)$, denoted with $f(x)$

*similar to: [[Cummulative Mass Function]]*
## Properties

- $\forall x \in S$, $f(x) > 0$ (no events  have a 0 probability)
- $\sum_{x \in S} f(x) = 1$ (all events  add up to 1)
- $P(X \in A) = \sum_{x \in A} f(x)$ where $A \subset X$ (all events are disjoint)
