> [[Chi Square Distribution]]

Numbers under $r$ is the $df$ ie degrees of freedom of the distribution. If not given, its $n - 1$.

Probabilities under $P(X \leq x)$ is the probability to $X \leq$ the corresponding number in the column/row. 

Examples:
$P(X < 13.85)$ when $X \sim \chi^2(24)$
- Find row where $r = 24$, then find the number $13.85$. The answer is the probability directly above, in this case $0.05$.
