Usually specified with captial variables $X, Y, Z, W, U, V$
- Kind of like a function
	- Example: Rolling a fair die $S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ . For each element in $S$, $X(s) = s$. The space of the random variable is also $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.
With values specified in lowercase $x,y,z,w...$ 

### Defining a random varibale
Sample space for rolling two die.

Example, we are interested in the sum of the number of spots (sum of the die's values), let this be the random variable $X$. 

$X$ assigns a real number to each outcome in the original space ex:
$X(\{1,1,\}) = 2, X(\{1,2,\}) = 3,X(\{2,1,\}) = 3, ... X(\{6,6\}) = 12$

The space of $X = \{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12\} = S$
The space fo $X$ cna be thought of as the sample space of the problem, and we can denote it as $S$. $S$ is called the **support** of $X$. 


If $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and contains a **countable** numbre of points. $S$ is the discrete sample space.

Any random variable $X$, with sample space $S$ is the discrete random variable.
