Events $A$ and $B$ are considered **independent** if 
- $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$

Also from [[Conditional Probability]], 
Events $A$ and $B$ are considered **independent** if 
- $P(A \mid B) = P(A)$ and $P(B \mid A) = P(B)$

## Pairwise independence
Every pair of events in a sample space is independent

## Mutual independence
*extended to sample spaces > 3*
Every subset of events in a sample space is independent


Pairwise independent $\implies$ mutually indepedent
