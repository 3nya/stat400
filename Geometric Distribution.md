A sequence of independent [[Bernoulli|bernoulli trials]] until the first success occurs.

If $X$ is the number of trials that until the first success, $X$ has a **geometric** distribution with parameter $p$.

## Properties

pmf:
$f(x) = p(1 - p)^{x-1}$ for $x = 1,2,3,...$

expected value:
$E[X] = 1/p$

variance:
$Var[X] =\frac{1 - p}{p^2}$
