$\sigma^2 = E[(X - \mu)^2] = \sum_{all x}(x - \mu)^2f(x)$
*also*
$Var[X] = E[X^2]-(E[X])^2$
Probability of the event happening * the distance from the mean.

The reason why its squared is to use absolute value (and not have it varied based on positive/negative).

[[Standard Deviation]] is the non absolute version of this.

*also known as the 3rd [[Moments|standard moment]]*
